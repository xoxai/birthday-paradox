# Birthday Paradox Checker

Idea: users open link (index.php) page. You open results.php page that updated online. Users type their birthdays and your script check if there are similar birthdays. 

Birthday paradox says that if users > 23 then probability of one pair of one-day birthday guys are ~0.5. Now you can check it in any audience interactively :)
